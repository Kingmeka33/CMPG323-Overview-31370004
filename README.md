# branching strategies
I will make use of GitFlow strategy for each project because it offers a detailed structure with a few clearly defined branches. 
This strategy will allow me to use each type of branch for parallel processing and provide quality assurance for all the projects.

1,There will be a main or master branch that will be used as the backup or stable version.

2,There will be a develop branch where new features will be created.

3,Features will be created on their own separete branch and will be merged with the develop branch once implemented.

4,Bug fixes/hot fixes will also be created on their own branch and will be merged with the develop branch.

5,After each successfull feature or fix is added to the develop branch and the current version of the develop branch is stable, it will be merged with the main branch to be kept as the latest backup.
